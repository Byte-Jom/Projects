/*
Z-Index
    This can be used to specify the stacking order of the elements in html
    Done by CSS
    Element should have a position (not static) for the z-index to take effect
    Media Query:
        @media <type> <feature>
        Can be used to style the website based on the screen size
    One can style with desktop->mobile or mobile->desktop
    As much as possible, each heading should have the same padding
    Code Refactoring:
        - Readability
        - Modularity
        - Efficiency
        - Length
    Dont put specific things into broad elements.
    Selectors can be combined in order to overwrite general selectors
    Spacing is important in the syntax below.
    Hierarchical Selectors
        - Heirarchy is right (parent) to left (child)
        Ex. parent child {}
            #title .container-fluid {}
        - Every element with the container-fluid class inside #title
    Multiple Selectors
        Ex. h1, h2, h3 {}
        - h1, h2, and h3 will all be changed
    Combined Selectors
        Ex. div.container-fluid {}
        - A div that has a class of container fluid
            .container.container-fluid
		- An element with the container AND container-fluid class
	
	Web Design
		Color Theory
			Red		- love, energy, intensity
					- buy this item now!
			Yellow	- joy, intellect,a ttention
					- impossible to not look at
					- may hurt eyes if looked at too long
			Green	- freshness, safety, growth
					- edible. more on food
			Blue 	- stability, trust, serenity
					- trustworthy. used more by business companies
			Purple	- royalty, wealth, femininity
		
			Combining Colors
				Analogous Colors
					- taking two colors next to each other in the color wheel
					- harmonious. works together
					- good for navigation bars and the body of the website
					- good for logo w/ background
					- not good at standing out
				Complementary Colors
					- taking two colors in the opposite ends of the color wheel
					- clashing palette
					- makes the colors stand out
					- dont use this with text w/ background
					- use for logos and icons
				Can also draw a triangle or square in the color wheel
					and take the colors from the corners
				Can use Adobe Color or ColorHunt
		
		Typography
			Serif
				- has feet
				- use if you want to make it look serious, have autority, older
				- good to use for a letter head in a legal company, magazine for architectural design
				Sub-Families:
					Old Style
						- older, aged
					Transitional
					Modern
						- authoretative but modern 
					Slab-Serif
				- traditional, stable, respectable
			
			Sans-Serif
				- has perfect right angles
				- makes it friendly, approachable, novel, contemporary
				- sensible, simple, straightforward
				- mostly used by startups
				- used in body text to make it more legible and readable
				Sub-Families:
					Grotesque
					Neo-Grotesque
					Humanist
						- a highly readable typeface
						- all fonts here
						- makes the people more likely to read it

					Geometric

			When looking for fonts with high legibility and readability, look for:
				Open Shapes
				Ample Intercharacter Spacing
				Unambiguous Forms
				Varying Proportions

			Using lots of fonts can make for a design that is cluttered, overcomplicated, and just not very nice. 
			But if you just use a small selection (2 fonts in 1 design), you can keep your design cleaner, clearer and just much easier to digest

			Combining Fonts
				- go for fonts with similar moods (ex. andes, bougan), and time era (garamond, ocean sans std)
				- contrast serif-ness (ex. myriad, minion) different for heading and body.
				- contrast in weights. heading should be reeaally bold (black or bold) while body is thin, regular, light 
			
			Never ever use Kristen, Greek Letters, Curlz, Viner, Papyrus, Comic Sans
			Think what to convey

		User Interface (UI) Design
			- aesthetic. what looks good and forcing that on the user
			Heirarchy
				Color
					- colors that contrast with their background are used for high heirarchy
				Size
					- bigger items draw eyes to it

			Layout
				- add block of text, pics, different sizes not just lines of text
				Line Length
					- aim for 40-60 characters per line for them to be interested
					Too long
						- tedious to read
					Too short
						- awkward to read

			Alignment
				- same alignment for the title and body to make it more consistent
				- reduce the number of alignment points to make it more coherent

			White Space
				- empty space around the text or element
				- space things out to make it look more expensive
				- makes it more minimalist and elevated

			Design for your Audience
				- think what will appeal to your desired audience
				- have the flexibility in your design skills

		User Experience (UX) Design
			- meant to be invisible
			- amkes it unobtrusive and lets you do your thing and it feels like as if everything is easy and everything is effortless
			Simplicity
				- better than making it more complex/cluttered
			Consistency
				- make the design and functionality consistent
				- ex. same design for the navbar in diff parts of the website
			Reading Patterns
				- most common reading pattern is the 
				F-Pattern
					- top left to top right then goes down in the left gutter
					- have the most important contents on the left gutter
				Z-Layout
					- left to right then zigzag down
			All Platform Design
				- design for both desktop and mobile
				- make it mobile responsive and desktop responsive
				- avoid so many banners and cookies
				- avoid massive scaling in mobile
			Don't Use Your Powers for Evil
				Dark Patterns
					- makes the user to perform an action or behavior that is beneficial to the company/designer
					- bad user experience
				- good design is helping people do what they want to do and give them a good experience
